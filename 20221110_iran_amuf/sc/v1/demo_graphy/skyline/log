The demographic dynamics of the 8 population were further investigated by Bayesian Skyline Plots (BSP) [@drummondBayesianCoalescentInference2005] using the
Bayesian skyline plot model implemented in BEAST 2.0
[22] following [23]. In brief, the HKY + G + 1 nucleotide
substitution model was used for the analysis, and each
Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC) run
was performed for 2000 million generations that were
sampled every 2,000 generations. The initial two million
generations served as burn-in. Convergence of the poste-
rior estimates of the Ne to the likelihood stationary distri-
bution was evaluated with TRACER v1.6 (http://tree.bio.
ed.ac.uk/software/treestat/). Since there is no available
mutation rate for sheep D-loop, we calibrated the BSPs
using the molecular rate of evolution (µ) of cattle mtDNA
D-loop of 6.94 × 10 − 7 substitutions/site/year [s/s/y; 95%
highest posterior density interval (HPD) 4.52 × 10 − 7–
9.35 × 10-7s/s/y] [24]. The final BSP plot was generated
using outputs from TRACER v1.5 and displayed using
MICROSOFT EXCEL (Microsoft Corporation).

The DNA region analyzed was a highly variable 721-nt long segment of the mtDNA control region, running from base 15,541 to base 16,261 in relation to the full mitochondrial sequence (accession number NC001941; Hiendleder, Lewalski et al. 1998).
