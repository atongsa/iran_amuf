Armenian mouflon (Armenian red sheep), O. g. gmelini (Blyth, 1851): nominate subspecies; native to northwestern Iran, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. It has been introduced to Texas in the U.S.
Esfahan mouflon, O. g. isphahanica (Nasonov, 1910): Zagros Mountains, Iran.
Laristan mouflon, O. g. laristanica (Nasonov, 1909): a small subspecies, its range is restricted to some desert reserves near Lar in southern Iran.


In the ovine and caprine genomes, the most abundant transposable element (TE) families were L1, L2 and RTE-BovB of LINEs (long interspersed nuclear element), tRNA-Core-RTE, Core-RTE and MIR of SINEs (short interspersed nuclear element), ERVL-MaLR, ERVL and ERVK of LTRs (long terminal repeat), and hAT-Charlie of DNA transposons (Fig. 3B, C, E, F, Additional file 1: Fig. S6, Additional file 2: Table S19). In both the Ovis and Capra genera, the distribution of the SV and TE families showed increased numbers of SVs with lengths of 100 – 150 bp and 7,500 – 8,000 bp, which could probably come from the tRNA-Core-RTE and L1/RTE-BovB families, respectively (Fig. 3B, C, E, F, Additional file 1: Fig. S6).
