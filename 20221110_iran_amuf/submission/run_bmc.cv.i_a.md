Our manuscript researched the structure of iranian asiatic mouflon and found the phylogenetics and gene flow of iranian asiatic mouflon with domestic sheep. So our manuscript meets the fileds of phylogenetics and evolution in 'Genetics selection evolution'. All the authors declare no competing interests and all authors have approved the manuscript for submission. Our paper had been submited to bioRxiv (doi: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561316).

Dear Editor,

We are writing to submit our manuscript entitled "Genomic analyses of Asiatic Mouflon in Iran provide insights into the domestication and evolution of sheep" for consideration in "Genetics Selection Evolution."

Our research delves into the structural analysis of the Iranian Asiatic mouflon, shedding light on the phylogenetics and gene flow between this population and domestic sheep. We believe that our findings make a meaningful contribution to the fields of phylogenetics and evolution. All authors involved in this study declare that they have no competing interests, and we would like to confirm that all authors have given their approval for the manuscript's submission. Furthermore, our paper has already been submitted to bioRxiv under the following DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561316.

This study assembled 606 mitogenomes covering 139 breeds and two wild species. We integrated our dataset and public dataset and conducted a comprehensive population genomics analysis of Asiatic mouflons in Iran with 780 whole-genome sequences, 767 whole mitogenomes, and 239 Y chromosomes to elucidate the contributions of various Asiatic mouflon subspecies in Iran to the domestication of sheep. We further investigated the impact of wild introgression of the Asiatic mouflon subspecies in Iran on the genomes of domestic sheep populations in South and Southeast Asia. 
We revealed two subpopulations of the Asiatic mouflons in Iran: O. gmelini_2 limited in Kabudan and O. gmelini_1 over a wide geographic area by whole genome sequence analyses. The introgression analyses detected significant signals of genetic introgression from O. gmelini_2 to four sheep populations (e.g., Garut, Garole, Bangladeshi, and Sumatra) in South and Southeast Asia. The introgression could have contributed to their small body size and local adaptation to the hot and humid environments in the Indian Peninsula.
We observed different genetic population structures among uniparental and autosome markers. Phylogenetic analyses of the Asiatic mouflons in Iran based on uniparental variants revealed a monophyletic lineage with the mitochondrial haplogroups C+E, and clustered into a monophyletic with Y-chromosomal lineage HY2 of sheep. The results suggested that the maternal haplogroups C+E and paternal lineage HY2 could have originated from the Asiatic mouflon in Iran. Our findings provide new insights into the origin of uniparental inheritance and subsequent introgressions from wild ancestors to domestic populations.
