Our results show that the Iranian mouflon is not the ancestor of domestic sheep but may contribute to the gene pool of domestic sheep through introgression. The sheep MtC/E and Y2 lineage is closely related to O.orientalis_1, which may have been introgressed by this mouflon population. The results of our autochromosome admixture, demography, and introgression analysis indicate that four SSA breeds may be undergoing adaptive introgression, resulting in the ability to exhibit dwarf size and adapt to wet and hot environments. The AI region regulates the expression of PCDH9, which influences fat deposition and bone size.

Previous studies have concluded that Eastern Anatolia is the only domestic center of domestic sheep [@peters2005upper; @zederDomesticationEarlyAgriculture2008]. Our results reject Iran as the domestic center and instead confirm Eastern Anatolia as the only domestic center. However, there is still introgression from the Iranian mouflon into domestic sheep, and some domestic mitochondria and Y haplotypes may have directly contributed from the Iranian mouflon [@liHuSheepGenome2021]. Previous studies have found that Asiatic mouflon has introgressed into South Asian domestic sheep [@lvWholeGenomeResequencingWorldwide2022b; @caoHistoricalIntrogressionWild2021; @chenWholegenomeSequenceAnalysis2021b; @chenWholegenomeSequenceAnalysis2021b], but did not illustrate the adaptive introgression of dwarf size from Asiatic mouflon.

PCDH9 has been associated with local adaptation in sheep and goats [@serranitoLocalAdaptationsMediterranean2021a] and is linked to hot, arid environments [@kimMultipleGenomicSignatures2016a]. The deficiency of PCDH9 has been shown to reduce positive emotional behavior [@uemuraDeficiencyProtocadherinLeads2022], while PCDH9 is associated with fat deposition in domestic sheep breeds from Africa and Eurasia [@mastrangeloNovelKnownSignals2019a]. Our results show that the AI region was in the same haplotype as PCDH9, and may regulate the expression of PCDH9, influencing the development of fat and bone size of Garole sheep, which may improve their adaptation to hot and wet environments in India's coastal region.

Our study needs further experimentation to prove the regulation of the PCDH9 gene on the influence of sheep fat and bone size, which may contribute to the breeding of sheep and genomic conservation.
