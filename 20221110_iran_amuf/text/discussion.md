Our results showed that the Iranian mouflon is not ancestor of domestic sheep, but may contribute to the gene pool of domestic sheep through introgression. The sheep MtC/E and Y2 lineage is so near to O.orientalis_1, which maybe introgressed by this mouflon pop. The autochromosome admixture, demography, and introgression analysis results showed that 4 SSA breeds maybe under adaptive introgression, and get the ability of drawf size to adaptive to the wet and hot environment. The ai region regulate the expression PCDH9, and influence the fat deposition and bone size.

Previous study conclude that eastern anotolian as the only domestic center of domestic sheep [@peters2005upper; @zederDomesticationEarlyAgriculture2008]. Our results reject Iran as the domestic center, and proove laterally eastern anotolian as the only domestic center. But there is still introgression from Iranian mouflon into domestic sheep, some domestic mitochondria and Y haplotype maybe contribute directly from Iranian mouflon [@liHuSheepGenome2021]. Previous study founds that asiatic mouflon introgressed into south asia domestic sheep [@lvWholeGenomeResequencingWorldwide2022b; @caoHistoricalIntrogressionWild2021; @chenWholegenomeSequenceAnalysis2021b; @chenWholegenomeSequenceAnalysis2021b], but don't illustrate the adaptive introgression of drawf size from asiatic mouflon.

PCDH9 has been associated with local adaptation in sheep and goats [@serranitoLocalAdaptationsMediterranean2021a] and is linked to hot, arid environments [@kimMultipleGenomicSignatures2016a]. Deficiency of PCDH9 has been shown to reduce positive emotional behavior [@uemuraDeficiencyProtocadherinLeads2022], while PCDH9 is associated with fat deposition in domestic sheep breeds from Africa and Eurasia [@mastrangeloNovelKnownSignals2019a]. Our results showed that the ai region was in the same haplotype with PCDH9, and may regulate the expression PCDH9, influence the development of fat and bone size of garole sheep, which may improve the adaptation of hot and wet environment in india coastal.

Our study needs further experiment to proof the regulation of PCDH9 gene on the influence of sheep fat and bone size, which may contribute to the breeding of sheep and genomic convervation.
