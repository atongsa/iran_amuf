# introduction
Sheep were domesticated approximately 10,500 years ago in southeastern Anatolia, as evidenced by bone assemblages [@peters2005upper; @zederDomesticationEarlyAgriculture2008] and genetic analysis [@demirciMitochondrialDNADiversity2013]. However, it is unclear whether Iran was also a center for domestic sheep. In this study, we aim to investigate the genetic evidence to determine whether Iran played a role in sheep domestication.

Previous research has identified two migratory waves of sheep at approximately 4.5–6.8 ka across eastern Eurasia [@lvMitogenomicMetaAnalysisIdentifies2015a]. The early dispersal of domestic sheep into Central Asia has been dated to 8 kBP [@taylorEvidenceEarlyDispersal2021a], while the first domestic sheep arrived in Africa about 7kBP, potentially representing thin-tailed sheep [@muigaiOriginAfricanSheep2013a]. According to Y analysis, the first expansion of early domestic hair sheep and the later expansion of fat-tailed sheep occurred ∼11,800–9,000 years BP and ∼5,300–1,700 years BP, respectively [@dengPaternalOriginsMigratory2020b]. In Europe, the replacement of the first domesticated sheep by wool sheep may have already started by 4000 BCE [@epsteinCattleMasonEditor1984]. Recent research by Lv et al. [@lvWholeGenomeResequencingWorldwide2022a] suggests that sheep originated in the Near East, passed through Iran, and into South and Southeast Asia. However, there is limited research on how SSA breeds adapted to hot and wet environments. Our study reveals that Iranian mouflon introgressed into some SSA breeds, supporting the findings of Lv et al., and we further demonstrate that Iranian mouflon introgressed into SSA breeds, and certain haplotypes facilitated the adaptation of these breeds to hot and wet environments by reduce fat size, bone size, and anti Nematodirus. Garole is a breed of sheep reared in the Sunderban region of India and Bangladesh, and these animals are well-adapted to the hot and humid coastal region, often grazing in water [@banerjeeUtilisationGaroleSheep2009]. This breed has gained recent attention due to its prolificacy, lambing frequency, disease resistance, and other unique merits rarely observed in other sheep breeds of the world [@banerjeeProductivityGeneticPotential2010a]. However, it is unclear whether Garole sheep adapted to local environments through de-domestication or introgressed characteristics.

PCDH9 has been associated with local adaptation in sheep and goats [@serranitoLocalAdaptationsMediterranean2021a] and is linked to hot, arid environments [@kimMultipleGenomicSignatures2016a]. Deficiency of PCDH9 has been shown to reduce positive emotional behavior [@uemuraDeficiencyProtocadherinLeads2022], while PCDH9 is associated with fat deposition in domestic sheep breeds from Africa and Eurasia [@mastrangeloNovelKnownSignals2019a]. However, the mechanism by which PCDH9 improves the adaptation of Garole sheep to the Indian coastal environment remains unclear. Further research is needed to clarify this relationship.
