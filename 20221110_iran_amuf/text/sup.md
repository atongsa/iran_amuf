In all three types of output, we order P1 and P2 so that nABBA>= nBABA. As a result, the D statistic is always positive and all the results, including the f4-ratio and other statistics reflect evidence of excess allele sharing between P3 and P2 for each trio.

Under the null hypothesis, which assumes no gene flow, the ABBA and BABA patterns are expected to occur due to incomplete lineage sorting with equal frequencies, and a significant deviation from that expectation is consistent with introgression between P3 and either P1 or P2. See Figure 1, (Patterson et al., 2012) and (Durand et al., 2011) for more detail.

A common candidate region located on OAR10:40.2â€“45.0 Mb observed in the two groups of Ethiopian sheep, Libyan Barbary and Laticauda, includes the PCDH9 gene. The same signature was detected by Kim et al. [36] who contrasted the Egyptian Barki sheep with British breeds, and referred to it as signal of adaptation to arid environments. However, the Barki is a fat-tail sheep while the British are all thin-tail breeds. We would then propose the idea that this is a signal of fat-deposition, this being corroborated by the presence of PCDH9, reported by Wang et al.

The strongest PCAdapt signals corresponded to: PAK1 and the KLHL1/PCDH9 intergenic region, both described previously as being involved in environmental adaptation
