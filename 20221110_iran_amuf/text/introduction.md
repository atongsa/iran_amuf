# introduction
Sheep was domesticted about 10,500 BP at southeastern Anntolia with bone assemblages [@peters2005upper; @zederDomesticationEarlyAgriculture2008] and genetic evidence [@demirciMitochondrialDNADiversity2013] as proof. But no proof whether Iran is the domestic centor of domestic sheep, here we want to prove at the genetic level that whether Iran is the domestication center.
Previouse research has revealed two sheep migratory waves at approximately 4.5–6.8 ka across eastern Eurasia [@lvMitogenomicMetaAnalysisIdentifies2015a]. Early dispersal of domestic sheep into Central Asia dated to 8 kBP [@taylorEvidenceEarlyDispersal2021a]. The first domestic sheep arrived into Africa about 7kBP, which maybe thin-tailed sheep [@muigaiOriginAfricanSheep2013a]. According Y analysis, the first expansion of early domestic hair sheep and the later expansion of fat-tailed sheep occurred ∼11,800–9,000 years BP and ∼5,300–1,700 years BP, respectively [@dengPaternalOriginsMigratory2020b]. In europe, The replacement of the first domesticated sheep by wool sheep may have already started by 4000 BCE [@epsteinCattleMasonEditor1984]. According the research of lv et al [@lvWholeGenomeResequencingWorldwide2022a], sheep pass from near east through iran and into south and southeastern asia. But how the SSA breeds adapted into the hot and wet environments, there is not much research. Our results showed that Iranian mouflon introgressed into some SSA breeds, which fit the founds of lv et al, we further point that irannina mouflon introgreed into SSA breeds, and some adapted haplotype helped the adaptation of these breeds in hot and wet environments. Garole is a breed of sheep reared in the Sunderban region of India and Bangladesh. The animals of this breed are adapted to the hot and humid coastal region and are often seen grazing in water[@banerjeeUtilisationGaroleSheep2009]. This sheep is the latest sensations in the world of domestic species by virtue of its prolificacy, lambing frequency, disease resistance and other extraordinary merits rarely or not even observed in other sheep breeds of the world [@banerjeeProductivityGeneticPotential2010a]. Dese garole sheep adapted to local environments by deomestication or introgressed characteristics, this is a probem.
PCDH9 is associated in sheep and goat local adaptation [@serranitoLocalAdaptationsMediterranean2021a], associated with hot arid environment [@kimMultipleGenomicSignatures2016a]. Deficiency of PCDH9 leads to reduction of positive emotional behaviour [@uemuraDeficiencyProtocadherinLeads2022]. PCDH9 is associated with fat deposition in domestic sheep breeds from Africa and Eurasia [@mastrangeloNovelKnownSignals2019a]. How does the PCDH9 improved the adaptation of garole sheep into india coastal environments, there is no to clarify.
