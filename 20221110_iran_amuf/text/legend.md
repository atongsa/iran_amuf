Fig. 6 Candidate gene PCDH9 associated with the significant introgression region on Chr10. a Linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks in the significant introgression region and gene PCDH9 (chr10:41,104,271-43,073,231). The red and yellow bars represent the location of the significant introgression region and gene PCDH9; b LD decay in introgressed sheep. The black line is calculated from the whole 10 chromosomes, the red line is calculated from the beginning of the significant region to the next 800 kb (chr10:41,204,271-42,004,271); c Dxy and FST around the significant introgression region on Chr10  (chr10:41,104,271-41,313,804), calculated by pixy v1.2.7.beta1; d Haplotype pattern of the significant introgression region on Chr10 (chr10:41,204,271-41,213,804) (left) and exons of PCDH9 (right).
