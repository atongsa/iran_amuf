# abstract
Sheep was domesticted about 10,500 BP at southeastern Anntolia with bone assemblages as proof [@peters2005upper; @zederDomesticationEarlyAgriculture2008] and genetic proof [@demirciMitochondrialDNADiversity2013]. Here we want to prove at the genetic level that whether Iran is the domestication center. We used 780 autosome samples, 950 mitochondria samples and 239 Y samples to do phylogenetic and haplonet analysis, reconstruct the sheep demography and introgression analysis. And we found that Iran is not the domstication centor, but may had introgression to some SSA breeds (Garut, Garole, Bangladeshi, and Sumatra), which promotes the adaptation of wet and hot environments through drawf size. Our results clarify the complex improvement process of domestic sheep and may help the improvement of sheep breeding to adaptive extreme environments and change body size for more meat production.
