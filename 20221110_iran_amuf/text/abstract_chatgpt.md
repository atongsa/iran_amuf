# abstract
Sheep were domesticated approximately 10,500 BP in southeastern Anatolia, as evidenced by bone assemblages [@peters2005upper; @zederDomesticationEarlyAgriculture2008] and genetic analysis [@demirciMitochondrialDNADiversity2013]. In this study, we aimed to determine whether Iran was a sheep domestication center at the genetic level. To accomplish this, we analyzed 780 autosome samples, 950 mitochondrial samples, and 239 Y samples using phylogenetic and haplotype network analysis, reconstructed the sheep demography, and performed introgression analysis. Our findings indicate that Iran was not a sheep domestication center; however, there is evidence of introgression from Iranian breeds to some SSA breeds, including Garut, Garole, Bangladeshi, and Sumatra. This introgression may have promoted adaptation to wet and hot environments by reducing sheep size. Our results shed light on the complex domestication process of sheep and provide insights for improving sheep breeding for extreme environments and increasing meat production by altering body size.
